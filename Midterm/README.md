**Midterm Updates**

For the midterm, I had initially decided I want to try to create a game like "Match the Tiles". However, after the IM showcase, having been in the same table as a two player Pong Game, I wanted to see if I could create a single player pong game. This came from the idea that we were waiting around for people to come interact with the games for most of the showcase, and I couldnt help but wanting to be able to play all the games on my own.
