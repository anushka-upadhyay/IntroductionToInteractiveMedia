**Final Project Potential Ideas** 

1. Whac-a-mole 

I would create the game of whac-a-mole with LED lights being the "mole" and have buttons to "Whack" them. I was also considering if the buttons could be senors like light or distance measuring sensors. The score would either show up on Processing or on an LCD screen. 

2. Musical Instrument 

I would create a musical instrument that uses light sensors and lasers that would act as a "string". This would almost look like a person is creating music with the air but the lasers also create a visual element. 

3. Make your own Lamp 

I was thinking that there would be a menu on Processing that would let the user choose the different colors and effects they would like on the lamp. The effects could include blinking, speed, fading, etc. of lights. There could also be a touch sensor that turns the lamp on and off. 

Notes from class: 

-1&3 would be the best ideas
-theremin 
-neopixels for lamp 
-check arduino laser harp
