**Final Project Potential Ideas** 

1. Whac-a-mole 

I would create the game of whac-a-mole with LED lights being the "mole" and have buttons to "Whack" them. I was also considering if the buttons could be senors like light or distance measuring sensors. The score would either show up on Processing or on an LCD screen. 

2. Musical Instrument 

I would create a musical instrument that uses light sensors and lasers that would act as a "string". This would almost look like a person is creating music with the air but the lasers also create a visual element. 

3. Make your own Lamp 

I was thinking that there would be a menu on Processing that would let the user choose the different colors and effects they would like on the lamp. The effects could include blinking, speed, fading, etc. of lights. There could also be a touch sensor that turns the lamp on and off. 

Notes from class: 

-1&3 would be the best ideas
-theremin 
-neopixels for lamp 
-check arduino laser harp

I had a new idea for my final project.

I wanted to do an installation that attempts to show how mental illness physically inhabits my body. So my current vision would be to create a simple outline of a body, maybe using white cloth, and hang it or stick it against a wall. Ideally it would be the outline of my own body. There will be buttons that represent each part of the body I experience pain in. The users/audience can press buttons as much as the want/whenever they want and this would be connected to a reaction specific to that part of the body. 

Examples: 
-If they press the button labelled chest, I would have a needle attached to a servo motor that would move in a way to prick the cloth while the button is pressed to represent how my chest pains feels. The needles may also have red paint on them so it leaves a mark on the cloth everytime it pricks. 
-When people press the button for the ear, a high-pitched sounds plays in the headphones they're wearing. 
-When the button for knee is pressed, a servo motor attached to the cloth on the knee making it shake to represent knee-jerking/tapping/fidgeting 
-When the button for eyes is pressed, a live picture comes on the Processing/Java Screen that tries to capture what I see when my eyes are blurred at the height of my anxiety attacka. So moving transparent circles of different sizes, the lines getting blurry. I was thinking I could use noise pattern functions to create this. 
-When the button for nails in pressed you hear the sound of nail biting and a servo motor with a brush that has red paint moves around the nail area to represent building because of excessive skin biting/ fidgeting. 
-For the hair button, I'd have servo motors with black/brown thread tied loosely to them turn for the hair to fall off at regular intervals. 

The idea is that as time progresses, you can see the paint in parts of the body grow and 'damage' the cloth body. 

My concerns:
-I would need a lot of servo motors, and perhaps of different sizes? How do I set it up so that people can be close to a laptop to wear headphones and see the screen while also letting them access all the buttons and see the white cloth
-I feel like the code for this would work with things I've already learnt in class but what of some of these bring unexpected issues. 
-Is there a way I could randomise the movements of the servo motors so that if I were to use paint to show how the body is affected over time, the paint isn't just on one smart part of the area. 
-If I use paint I would also need to keep adding paint to the brush during the installation. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do that during the IM showcase? 
-Im also just generally concerned about how long it would take to make the code and generally setup all the hardware and troubleshoot. If the cloth is lifesize then there is also the problem of needing to find wires that are long enough, etc. 
-If I need to position the servo motors at specific places near the cloth I would need to build the project where the IM showcase is happening or do it somewhere and record the process for the showcase?
