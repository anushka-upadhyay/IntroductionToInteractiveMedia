**Final Project Updates**


**Finalized concept for the project**

I have decided that I will make a simplified version of the installation that I shared in the "Ideas.md" file. The installation will attempt to show how mental illness physically inhabits my body. There will be a small 2D cloth outline of a body. There will be buttons that represent each part of the body I experience pain in. The users/audience can press buttons as much as the want/whenever they want and this would be connected to a reaction specific to that part of the body. 

Here is a rough sketch of the installation:

Eyes: 
When the buton is pressed a screen with moving circles/swirls will come up on the Processing Java Window. 

Ears: 
When the button is pressed a high-pitched sound will play on the headphones that the user will be wearing. 

Chest: 
When the button is pressed the servo motor will rotate. The motor will have needles with red paint or markers attached to it so that with each rotation, it marks the cloth in red. 


**Final Video**

This is a video of my final project with all the components working. I was not able to take more pictures and videos because my phone's camera has been glitching, but I have tried to document other components as much as I could.
