**Final Project Updates**

**Final Concept** 

The project aims to allow the user to experience what anxiety feels like in my body. There are three components, related to the ears, eyes and chest that are each controlled by a button. The ears component is a soundscape played through Processing. The user will need to wear headphones for that. The eyes component is a visualization played through Processing. The chest component is performed by a servo motor through Arduino. If the user is comfortable they can place their hand in front of the servo motor to let the needle attached to them gently touch them. The three buttons that control each compoenent are attached to the breadboard and can be used one at a time, or all at once and the user is free to experiment with it.

**Final Video**

This is a video of my final project with all the components working. This was before the final setup at the IM showcase. I was not able to take more pictures and videos because my phone's camera has been glitching, but I have tried to document other components as much as I could. There are more pictures from when I was building the project in the "Journal.md" file.

**Reflection** 

The hardest part of the project was figuring out the hardware components and how to effectively users to exeperience what I experience without overwhelming them or making it too confusing. Given my limited skills in construction, I also needed to scale down my own vision. However, at the end, I had the users interact with the project using three different senses: sound, sight and touch; and I think that is as accurate of an experience as I could build for them through this project so I am very pleased with it. 

The other difficult part was definitely the making the sound work, and work with the other components, and make sure it wasn't static. There were many moments in debugging where I thought it was fixed and I'd be relieved but then it would stop wokring again and I had absolutely no idea what had gone right and what had gone wrong. However, when my friend taught me about minim and creating an audioplayer, it really helped and I was able to learn something new too!
