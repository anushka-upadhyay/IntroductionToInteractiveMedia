**Finalized concept for the project**

I have decided that I will make a simplified version of the installation that I shared in the "Ideas.md" file. The installation will attempt to show how mental illness physically inhabits my body. There will be a small 2D cloth outline of a body. There will be buttons that represent each part of the body I experience pain in. The users/audience can press buttons as much as the want/whenever they want and this would be connected to a reaction specific to that part of the body. 

Here is a rough sketch of the installation:

Eyes: 

When the buton is pressed a screen with moving circles/swirls will come up on the Processing Java Window. 

Ears: 

When the button is pressed a high-pitched sound will play on the headphones that the user will be wearing
