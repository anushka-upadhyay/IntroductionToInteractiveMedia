**Description of Arduino program**

The Arduino program will call on each program (eyes, ears, chest) when the button is pressed. The programs for ears and chest will be on Arduino but the program for the eyes will be on Processing so it will be sending the signal that the eyes button is pressed to Processing. 

**Description of Processing program** 

The Processing program will have a home screen that explains the installation at all times. This screen will change when the eyes button is pressed, it recieves this signal from Arduino and the screen will instead display a visualization/art peice instead. 

If time permits, I will have descriptions of each (Eyes, ears, chest) appear on Processing when the signal that each button is pressed is received from Arduino. 

**The riskiest, most complicated, or most unknown part of project**

The most complicated part of the project is building the hardware. I had initially thought of building a live size cloth outline of the body to add more "humanness" to the installation. However, after recieving feedback that I don't have enough training to do proper contruction , I have decided to downscale the project and make a smaller/simpler version of the project. I still however, need to experiment with each of the components, especially the servo motor to ensure that it moves the way I want it to. 

**Building the project** 


-started with circuit for switches, used example to make sure they work 

-build cloth outline for body, realized it needed much more hardware to make the presentation work, instead chose to have body lie on the table and create a stand for the servo motor


chest 

-attached needle on servo motor

-created code for it by finding right angle and speed that makes the motor move in a mannner that lets the needle "prick" the body rapidly but not too rapidly 

-connected it to switch 


ears 

-recorded sounds of breathing 

-downloaded sounds of crowd and ear ringing from youtube and editing on garageband to create a file that represented what i hear w social anxiety
